## Introduction

`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line packet analyzer that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic. This repository serves as a platform to highlight my proficiency in using `tcpdump` for network troubleshooting, analysis, and security monitoring. The labs included here showcase my ability to capture, filter, and analyze network packets to gain insights into network behavior and diagnose issues.

The labs in this repository cover a wide range of network scenarios and use cases. By exploring these labs, you will gain valuable hands-on experience in using `tcpdump` to dissect network traffic, identify anomalies, and extract valuable information from packets.

## Repository Structure

The TCPDump Labs Repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Packet Capturing Basics**: This section covers fundamental `tcpdump` usage. You will find labs on capturing packets on different network interfaces, specifying capture filters, and writing captured data to files.

2. **Packet Filtering and Analysis**: Here, you will find labs that delve into more advanced packet filtering and analysis techniques. Topics include filtering based on source/destination IP, port numbers, protocol types, and more. You will also learn about basic protocol analysis and extracting data from captured packets.

3. **Traffic Visualization**: This section focuses on visualizing captured network traffic. You will explore labs related to tools that can process and present `tcpdump` output in a more user-friendly manner, providing insights into traffic patterns and trends.

4. **Advanced Scenarios**: In this section, you will encounter labs involving complex network scenarios. This could include capturing traffic from specific devices, analyzing specific types of network attacks, or diagnosing intricate network issues.

5. **Security and Intrusion Detection**: Here, you will find labs that showcase how `tcpdump` can be used for security purposes. You'll explore tasks like detecting suspicious traffic patterns, identifying potential security breaches, and monitoring for signs of network intrusion.

## Usage

To make the most of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcpdump-labs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific lab directory you are interested in.

3. Each lab directory contains detailed instructions, scenarios, and expected outcomes. Read the instructions carefully to understand the objectives of each lab.

4. Use the `tcpdump` command-line tool on your Linux machine to complete the labs. You can capture packets on specific interfaces, apply filters, and save the captured data for analysis.

5. Analyze the captured packet data using various command-line tools or traffic analysis software. Extract meaningful information from the captured packets to accomplish the goals of each lab.

6. Feel free to experiment with different `tcpdump` options and explore additional packet analysis tools to enhance your understanding of network traffic.
